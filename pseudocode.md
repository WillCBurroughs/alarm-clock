## My Plan for project

### First Step
> First decide on what functionality I want my final project to have. After selecting the functionality start designing it on a figma file and have logical informational flow. Continue to 
until product flow and design looks good. This will now serve as a template for what I want to accomplish. I am using this figma prototype: https://www.figma.com/file/48v89X7OdRCfByRYNGgMXH/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=0VFhKKn0HlrMpkle-0

### Second Step
> Create all the files I know I will need for my project. I already should have a basic Idea of what I should do mainly for the HTML and CSS from the figma prototypes. Now I can break the tasks down into subtasks that need to be complete. Now I need to plan steps for finishing project <br/> <br/> 1. I need to get the correct time and date to be displayed on screen <br/> 2. I need to get what the user inputs as a time element and save that <br/> 3. I need to be able to test if the current Time listed is equal to one of the times that has been saved <br/> 4. I need to display saved times on the main screen <br/> 5. I need to be able to delete dates by selecting the associated x on each date item <br/> 6. I need to be able to snooze alarm and call a new alarm 5 mins later <br/> 7. I need to be able to allow user to drop file into computer and upload that as their desired sound alarm. <br/> 8. I need to make analog clock that has correct time and will autoadjust
